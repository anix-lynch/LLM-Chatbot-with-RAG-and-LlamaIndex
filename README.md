## 🤖 Building a Conversational Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project is all about building a smart, LLM-powered chatbot that can search Wikipedia and answer your questions based on the content of specific Wikipedia pages. We’re using **LlamaIndex**, **OpenAI**, and **Chainlit** to enhance the chatbot with **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, improving the quality of responses with real-world information. Ready to create an intelligent conversational assistant? Let’s get started! 💬📚

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a **conversational assistant** that’s powered by a large language model (LLM) and augmented with retrieval-based data from Wikipedia. By using **RAG**, the chatbot can retrieve relevant information from Wikipedia pages and incorporate it into its responses, providing more accurate and contextually rich answers.

We’ll use **LlamaIndex** to index Wikipedia pages into vector stores and then integrate that with **OpenAI's API** to generate responses. The conversational agent will use the **ReAct** framework, meaning it will reason through a question, choose a tool (like Wikipedia search), review the result, and then decide how to respond.

### Key Features:

- 📄 **Wikipedia Integration**: Index Wikipedia pages and use them to provide factual, up-to-date information in responses.
- 🧠 **ReAct Agent**: Implement a Reason and Act (ReAct) agent that intelligently uses tools step by step to answer questions.
- 🔍 **Custom Semantic Search**: Build a custom Wikipedia semantic search tool for better retrieval accuracy.
- 🖥️ **Interactive UI**: Create a real-time, conversational user interface using **Chainlit**.
- 🌐 **Live Wikipedia Search**: Test the agent on live Wikipedia pages and see how it pulls relevant information to answer questions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **OpenAI**: For LLM-powered response generation.
- **LlamaIndex**: To index and retrieve information from Wikipedia pages.
- **Chainlit**: For building the interactive chatbot UI.
- **Python**: For backend development and API integration.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and structure.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Artificial Intelligence
- Interactive Web Applications
- API Integration
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Front-end Development with Chainlit

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Search Wikipedia**: Input a topic or question, and the chatbot will search Wikipedia and respond with the most relevant information.
- **Conversational UI**: Interact with the chatbot in real-time through a web-based interface.
- **Custom Tool Integration**: Watch the agent reason through a question, select a tool, and use it to generate accurate answers.
